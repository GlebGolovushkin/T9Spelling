# Morph #  

Morph makes smooth animations and object movements in your presentation\. You use two similar slides to perform the animation\, but it looks to your audience like the action happens on one slide\.   
**Play** the video on the right to see a quick example\.  
Morph is a subscription\-only feature\. If you have an Office 365 subscription\, you can try it yourself with the steps on the next slide\.

3  

Return to the first of the two slides and press Slide Show button and then select Play to see your circle morph\!
