How to use PowerPoint Designer  
How it works\:  
![Image](./Images/Slide_3_Image_1.png)  
![Shape](./Images/Slide_3_Shape_1.svg)

Start a new presentation by going to File \> New \> Blank Presentation\.  
![Shape](./Images/Slide_3_Shape_2.svg)

On the very first slide\, add a picture\: Go to Insert \> Pictures or Insert \> Online Pictures and choose the picture\.

Morph  
Morph makes smooth animations and object movements in your presentation\. You use two similar slides to perform the animation\, but it looks to your audience like the action happens on one slide\.   
**Play** the video on the right to see a quick example\.  
Morph is a subscription\-only feature\. If you have an Office 365 subscription\, you can try it yourself with the steps on the next slide\.

Setting up Morph  
![Image](./Images/Slide_5_Image_1.png)  
Try it yourself with these two simple “planets”\:  
![Shape](./Images/Slide_5_Shape_1.svg)

1  
![Shape](./Images/Slide_5_Shape_3.svg)  
Duplicate this slide\: Right\-click the slide thumbnail and select Duplicate Slide\.  
![Shape](./Images/Slide_5_Shape_4.svg)  
![Shape](./Images/Slide_5_Shape_5.svg)  
2  
In the second of these two identical slides\, change the shapes on the right in some way \(move\, resize\, change color\)\, then go to Transitions \> Morph\.

![Image](./Images/Slide_5_Image_3.png)

Working together in real time  
When you share your presentation with others\, you’ll see them working with you at the same time\. 

How it works\:  
![Image](./Images/Slide_6_Image_1.png)  
![Image](./Images/Slide_6_Image_2.png)  
![Image](./Images/Slide_6_Image_3.png)  
![Shape](./Images/Slide_6_Shape_1.svg)  
1  
![Shape](./Images/Slide_6_Shape_2.svg)  
2  
![Shape](./Images/Slide_6_Shape_3.svg)  
3  
Select Share from above the ribbon\, or by using short\-key Alt\-ZS\, to invite people to work with you \(You can save to the cloud at this point\.\)  
When other people are in the presentation\, a marker shows who is on which slide…  
…and the part of the slide they\'re editing\.
